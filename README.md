# Todo List

Todo List aims to be a little project that will cover essential parts of the
C language.

It is not expected to finish the whole subject but try to get as much as you can.

As you only have few days before starting a real project, we provide you a unit test suite so you can quicly check your work.

Here are some tips to start your project well:

	- Keep your memory sane, not doing so might create unexpected behaviors 	  and your program might not be stable, use valgrind and ask for help
	- Keep your code clean, and follow EPITA coding style from the assistants, it will be a key factor when working in groups.
	- If you do not remember how to use GDB we can help you get started again but please debug your program before calling us after that.
	- Have fun ! :)


## 1/ A Task
#### Notions:
	
	- Memory allocation
	- Structs manipulation
	- Enumerations	

Your goal is to be able to create a Task

Look at the "task.h" header file, you have 4 functions to make:

First, this function should allocate a Task on the heap and then fill its 
proprieties with the given parameters
```c
struct Task* create_task(int id, char* title);
```

Whenever you allocate a complex structure on the Heap, you should think of a 
strategy to free so the next step is the detroy function:
```c
void destroy_task(struct Task* task);
```

Finally, the last task of this chapter is to create a printing function as such:
```c
void print_a_task(struct Task* task);
```

You can use test1.c like this to check that your work is corect (just replace
 ref1 by your filename)
 ```
➜  TodoList gcc test1.c ref1.c -o ref1
➜  TodoList ./ref1 | cat -e           
1: Become a light butterfly [TODO]$
2: Be under the projectors [TODO]$
➜  TodoList 
```

## 2/ Many tasks

#### Notions
	- Memory allocations
	- Pointers
	- Linked List
	
Now that you can create a task you will need to create a linked list to store
 all your tasks.
 
 To do so you have two struct to fill :
 ```c

/**
 * It will be the list containing all the tasks
 * I suggest you keep the pointer of the first element here
 */
struct TaskList {
  // TODO : Implement
};

/**
 * A node is an element of the list, it has the reference to the next element
 * an the task
 */
struct TaskListNode {
  // TODO : Implement
};
```

And the functions to create and free theses:
```c
// Inits a note structure containg a Task
struct TaskListNode* init_node(struct Task* task);

// Creates a list and returns its pointer
struct TaskList* init_list();

// Destroys a node
void free_node(struct TaskListNode* tln) {

// Destroy the list and all its elements
void destroy_list(struct TaskList *tl);
```

Now, you need to add Tasks to your list:
```c
// FIXME : Duplicate of push, merge it or keep it on chap 2?
// Adds the given task at the end of the list
void add_to_list(struct TaskList* tl, struct Task* task);
```

Last but not least print all the tasks contained on the list :
```c
// Prints all the tasks from the list
void print_all_tasks(struct TaskList* tl);
```

You can test your work with the test2.c file, compile it with all your 
project files and you shoudl have this output :
```bash
➜  TodoList git:(master) ✗ gcc ref1.c ref2.c test2.c -o test2 ; ./test2 | cat -e
1: Become a light butterfly [TODO]$
2: Be under the projectors [TODO]$
c
```

## 3/ Changing status of tasks

#### Notions
	- Enumerations
	- List operations (find, get, remove, push, pop)


You will need to code several funcitons to change the status of tasks, find a
 task.
 
 Here are the functions you need to implement :

```c
/*
 * Write a function that searches for a task, and return an int if it exists:
 * It exists:          0
 * It does not exist: -1
 */
int find_a_task(struct TaskList *tl, int id);

/*
 * Write a function that returns a task using its id.
 */
struct Task* get_task(struct TaskList *tl, int id);

/*
 * Write a function that removes a task using its id.
 */
void remove_task(struct TaskList *tl, int id);

/*
 * Write a function that appends a task to the list.
 */
void push_task(struct TaskList *tl, struct Task *task);

/*
 * Write a function that remove the first task in the list.
 */
void pop_tasklist(struct TaskList *tl);

``` 

## 4/ Saving and loading the list

#### Notions
	- File manipulation
	- Parsing files
	
Now that you can do anything you want with your task the last part is to save
 and load the file!
 
 You are free for the format of the file but you can ask us for an idea if 
 you want
 
```c
/*
 * Write a function that saves a TaskList to a file.
 * Format :
 *      count
 *      id
 *      title
 *      status
 *      id
 *      title
 *      status
 *      ...
 *      EOF
 */
void save_list(struct TaskList *tl, char *path);

/*
 * Write a function that load a file and creates the TaskList according to the
 * format.
 */
struct TaskList* load_list(char *path);

```
